#### `Course 1` : [**`Neural Network and Deep Learning`**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)

- In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, comprises the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning.
- Getting familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.
- Understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology.
- Programming assignments:
