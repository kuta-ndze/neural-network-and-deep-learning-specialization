## Deep Learning and Neural Network Specialization

Andrew Ng's specialization course for all my assignments in neural network and deep learning.

#### `Course 1` : Neural Network and Deep Learning

- In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, comprises the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning.
- Getting familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.
- Understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology.
